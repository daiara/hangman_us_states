Hangman US States

This is a slightly changed version of hangman from the book Invent your own Computer Games with Python, by Al Sweigart.

The user must have python3 installed in order for it to work. To run the game, just download hangman_us_states.py and run it.

Hangman is simple game of guessing a word letter by letter. The game begins by showing how many letters there is by using one _ per letter. Once it starts, just guess a letter and wait for the next input. Every correct guess the _ is substituted by that letter and every wrong guess the hangman gets a body piece. The game is over when the correct word is guessed or the man on the hang is complete. This version of hangman gives the player 5 wrong guesses, where the 6th one ends the game with a loss.

I did a few modifications on the original like adding a flag with colours, deleting a word from the list so it wouldn't repeat and adding a wins and loses counts at the end of the game.
